# Recruitment-webpage
I have built a responsive webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a modern layout with smooth transitions for a visually appealing, user-friendly experience across all devices. The main landing page, `index.html`, serves as the recruitment page for a college robotics club, providing essential information about the club and its recruitment process.

The `Courses.html` page offers a variety of IT-related courses, including robotics, IoT, AI, ML, data science, data analytics, and web development, designed to equip students with the necessary skills. 

The `Contact.html` page includes a form for students to reach out with questions or concerns, ensuring direct communication with the club. 

The `Recruitment.html` page details student information collected from the recruitment form, aiding in the assessment and decision-making process for new recruits. 

Overall, this project showcases a well-designed, functional, and responsive webpage that streamlines the club's recruitment process and engages potential members effectively.
