# Recruitment-webpage
I have built a responsive webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a modern layout with smooth transitions for a visually appealing, user-friendly experience across all devices. 🌐✨ The main landing page, `index.html`, serves as the recruitment page for a college robotics club, providing essential information about the Robotics🤖 club and its recruitment process. 📋

The `Courses.html` page offers a variety of IT-related courses, including robotics, IoT, AI, ML, data science, data analytics, and web development, designed to equip students with the necessary skills. 💻📚

The `Contact.html` page includes a form for students to reach out with questions or concerns, ensuring direct communication with the club. 📞✉️

The `Recruitment.html` page details student information collected from the recruitment form, aiding in the assessment and decision-making process for new recruits. 📝🔍

Overall, this project showcases a well-designed, functional, and responsive webpage that streamlines the club's recruitment process and engages potential members effectively. 🚀🎉
